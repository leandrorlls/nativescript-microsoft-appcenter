# Microsoft App Center plugin for NativeScript

## Requirements
Before you begin, please make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

### Node.js
- [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org)
is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

### NativeScript
 - [NativeScript](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/README.md)
is a framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS.

    NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine, no WebViews, resulting in native-like performance and UX.

### Microsoft App Center

- Android Version 4.0.3 (API level 15) or later.

- [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) brings together multiple services, commonly used by mobile developers, into a single, integrated product. You can build, test, distribute, and monitor your mobile apps, and also implement push notifications.

- Create your app in the App Center Portal to obtain the App Secret **(if you have already created your app in the App Center portal, you can skip this step)**.

- Head over to [Microsoft App Center](https://appcenter.ms).

- Sign up or log in and hit the blue button on the top right corner of the portal that says `Add new` and select `Add new app` from the dropdown menu.

- Enter a name and an optional desciption for your app.

- Select `Android` and `Java` **or** `iOS` and `Objective-C/Swift` as a platform.
